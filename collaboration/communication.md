## Communication Channels

Frequency and topics for each channel:

- *Slack:* Regular messaging for quick updates and collaboration.
- *Google Meet Video Calls:* Twice a week or as needed to discuss ongoing
  projects and important updates. Video call timing is determined
  based on a poll or decided verbally in the meeting,
   considering everyone's work schedules.

*Issues:* New challenges and meeting announcements.

*Pull Requests:* Used for code reviews.

*Discussions:* Sharing information about learning goals,
 constraints, Python, GitHub, etc.

## Availability

Given the diverse work schedules and life commitments of our group members,
it can be challenging to find a common time that works for everyone.

To address this, we typically conduct polls via Polly to determine
 the most convenient meeting times, or we decide on the next
  meeting time before ending the current one. Despite these scheduling
   challenges, we all strive to stay as active as possible on
    Slack to ensure consistent communication.

 Additionally, we try to record our meetings
     whenever possible for those who cannot attend.
 After each meeting, we provide a brief summary of
      what was discussed on the platform for those who
       couldnâ€™t join. Even though we can't always work
        synchronously and sometimes have to operate quite asynchronously,
        we make sure to keep each other updated.
