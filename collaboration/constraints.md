# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project

## External Constraints

- **Deadline:** We have a strict deadline to meet.
- **Time Pressure:** Limited time to study a large amount of new information, terms,
  websites, and materials.
- **Fixed Programming Language:** The programming language for this project is Python
  and cannot be changed.
- **Coding Standards:** All coding, documentation, and reviews will adhere to
  established rules based on reviewed examples.
- **Restricted Pushes:** We’re not allowed to push directly to the `master` branch.
- **Branch Merging Rules:** A branch can only be merged after a pull request has been
  reviewed and approved.
- **Team Size:** There are only 5 people on our team. This can be an advantage but
  also a limitation if we need more help.

## Internal Constraints (Involuntary)

- **Different Schedules:** Everyone has their own commitments, so it’s hard to find
  regular meeting times. But we’ll make sure to catch up and contribute equally.
- **Learning Together:** Some of us are still building our skills, so we’ll need to
  collaborate and support each other more as we learn.
- **Limited Availability:** Balancing this project with other responsibilities might
  sometimes make it hard to stay fully available.
- **Knowledge Gaps:** Some team members may lack experience in specific technologies
  or concepts being used in the project, requiring extra time for learning or
  mentoring.
- **Dependency on Others:** Progress might depend on tasks or decisions made by other
  team members or external stakeholders.
- **Limited Review Capacity:** Fewer people available to review pull requests or
  contributions, potentially slowing down approvals and progress.

## Internal Constraints (Voluntary)

- **Keeping It Simple:** We’re deliberately keeping the project scope small to
- make it
  easier to manage and avoid unnecessary complexity.
- **Following Rules:** We’ve decided to follow clear coding, documentation, and
  review rules to maintain quality and consistency.
- **Team Collaboration:** We’re committed to working together and ensuring everyone
  has a chance to contribute equally, even if it takes more time.
