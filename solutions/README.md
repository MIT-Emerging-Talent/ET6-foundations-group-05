# **Solutions**

This folder contains solutions to various coding challenges completed as part  
of the **Practice Code Review** for the **MIT Emerging Talent Program**.

Each solution includes:  

- A **Python implementation** of the challenge.  
- **Documentation** within the docstring to explain the functionâ€™s behavior,  
  input/output, constraints, raised exceptions, and doctests.  
- Corresponding **unit tests** in the `/tests` folder to verify correctness  
  and handle a variety of cases.

The goal of this repository is to **practice problem-solving skills**,  
**enhance code review abilities**, **collaborate effectively in a team**,  
and develop strong **asynchronous development workflows**.

You can learn more about the **learning goals** for this project by checking  
out **[`learning_goals.md`](collaboration/learning_goals.md)**.
