def longest_substring(s: str) -> int:
    """
    Determines the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string to be evaluated. Must have a length between 0 and 5 * 10^4.
                 The string consists of English letters, digits, symbols, and spaces.

    Returns:
        int:
            The length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
            Returns 0 if the input string is empty.

    Raises:
        AssertionError:
            If the input is not a string.
        AssertionError:
            If the input string length is not within the valid range (0 <= len(s) <= 5 * 10^4).
