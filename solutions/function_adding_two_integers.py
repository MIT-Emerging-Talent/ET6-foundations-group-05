Explanation:
Unit Test Framework:

The script uses the unittest module from Python's standard library to create and run tests.
Import Statement:

Replace your_module with the actual name of your module containing the sum function.
Test Cases:

Each test case ensures the function works for specific scenarios:
Positive integers.
Negative integers.
Mixed positive and negative integers.
Zero.
Test Method Naming:

Each test method starts with test_ to be recognized by the unittest framework.
Assertions:

The self.assertEqual method compares the actual output of the sum function to the expected result.
Running Tests:

When executed, the script runs all test cases and reports success or failure.
By running this script, you can verify that the sum function is robust and handles different types of input correctly.

Explanation:
Standard Tests:

These test common, expected use cases such as adding positive integers, negative integers, a mix of both, and zero.
H Case Tests:

Test edge cases like adding extremely large numbers, the minimum and maximum integer values, and numbers very close to zero.
Defensive Tests:

Test the function’s behavior when provided with invalid inputs, such as strings, floats, missing arguments, extra arguments, or None.
These ensure the function raises appropriate exceptions (TypeError in this case).
Benefits:
Clear categorization ensures better test coverage and maintainability.
Each category targets a specific type of scenario, making it easier to identify and fix issues.

All references to "H Case Tests" have been replaced with "Edge Case Tests" in the code and comments.
Updated Docstrings:

Updated descriptions for the Edge Case category to reflect its purpose more accurately.
This ensures the terminology is consistent with the commonly used "Edge Case" naming convention, making the test file easier to understand and maintain.

     ### **Challenge Description**

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.


### Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,1]

Output: 1

### Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]

Output: 4

### Example 3:

Input: nums = [1]

Output: 1

 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104
Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

To solve the LeetCode problem where every element in an array appears twice except for one, and you need to find that single element, you can utilize the XOR bitwise operator. The XOR operator has a unique property: when you XOR two identical numbers, the result is 0, and any number XORed with 0 remains unchanged. By XORing all the elements in the array together, the pairs will cancel each other out, leaving only the single number that appears once.

Here's how you can implement this in Python:

python
Copy code
def single_number(nums):
    result = 0
    for num in nums:
        result ^= num
    return result
Explanation:

Initialize result to 0.
Iterate through each number in the array.
Apply the XOR operation between result and the current number.
After processing all numbers, result will hold the single number that appears only once.
This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), making it efficient for large arrays.

Updated Function:
python
Copy code

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): A list of integers where all elements appear exactly twice

    Returns:
        int: The integer that appears only once in the input list.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input list is empty.

    """
    if not nums:  # Check if the list is empty
        raise ValueError("Input list cannot be empty.")
    
    result = 0
    for num in nums:
        result ^= num
    return result
Test Assertion:
The test already correctly checks for the raised exception. Ensure it’s included as follows:

python
Copy code
def test_empty_list(self):
    """
    Edge Case: Test with an empty list (invalid input).
    """
    with self.assertRaises(ValueError, msg="Failed on empty input list"):
        single_number([])
Explanation:
The updated function raises a ValueError when the input list is empty.
The test uses with self.assertRaises(ValueError) to confirm that the exception is properly raised.
The msg argument in assertRaises provides additional context if the test fails.
This ensures the function adheres to constraints and appropriately handles invalid inputs like an empty list.
